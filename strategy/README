The objective of the strategy pattern is include classes inside another class.
One thing I have learnt in this php pattern is that if you have got a method with the same name of the class, when you instance the class, you call the method of the class. Example:

class Quack implements QuackBehavior
{
    /**
     * This is the quack function;
     */
    public function quack()
    {
        echo( 'Quack');
    }
}

$mallard_duck = new MallardDuck();

//This will echoes 'Quack'
